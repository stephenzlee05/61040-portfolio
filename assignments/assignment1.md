### 1. Health & Activity
I started lifting weights at the gym a couple of years ago, and now I go consistently. I feel like the gym as well as any other physical activity such as sports should be a part of everyone's day to day lives. Keeping your body in shape is important and should not be ignored.

### 2. Personal Finance
After getting some income in college, I always wanted a way to keep track of my expenses. I wanted to make sure I don't spend my entire paycheck and leave the rest for savings. In the future, the savings would build up for larger purchases, such as a car or house. 

### 3. Technologies
In such a technology dominated world, I want to keep up to date with any new technologies. As technology advances exponentially, I want to make sure I don't get left behind. I am also interested in PC building, so new parts are crucial to thinking about how performance can improve.


## Problems

### Health & Activity
1. **Forgetting previous workouts or weights**: Sometimes I forget how much weight I put on an exercise or if I should increase the weight after some amount of time. This is important because slowly building up weight is key to muscle growth.
2. **Improving sleep quality**: As a student, sleep is very important. Not only the amount of time but also the quality. Time throughout the day needs to be appropriately managed to get the suggested amount of sleep. Keeping track and building habits should hopefully improve sleep quality as well.
3. **Tracking nutrition and meal planning**: It's difficult to maintain a consistent diet that supports fitness goals. Planning meals, tracking macronutrients, and ensuring proper nutrition intake throughout busy student life is challenging but crucial for optimal health and performance.

### Personal Finance
1. **Overspending on unnecessary items**: It's easy to make impulse purchases, especially with online shopping and food delivery apps. Without proper tracking, small expenses add up quickly and can derail savings goals.
2. **Inconsistent budgeting and expense tracking**: Manually tracking every expense is tedious and often gets forgotten. Without a clear view of spending patterns, it's difficult to identify areas where money could be saved or better allocated.
3. **Lack of financial planning for future goals**: Without proper planning, it's hard to know how much to save for specific goals like a car, house, or emergency fund. Understanding how current spending habits affect long-term financial security is crucial.

### Technologies
1. **Staying current to new technologies**: With technology advancing rapidly, it's overwhelming to keep up with all the latest developments, updates, and new products across different tech sectors.
2. **Making informed purchasing decisions**: When building PCs or buying tech products, it's difficult to research and compare all available options, especially with constantly changing prices and new releases that affect the value proposition of existing products.
3. **Learning new technologies and skills**: As new technologies emerge, there's pressure to continuously learn and adapt. Finding the right resources and time to develop new technical skills while managing other responsibilities is challenging.

## Selection

### 1. Forgetting previous workouts or weights
This problem is highly worth pursuing because it's a specific, well-defined issue that directly impacts fitness progress. I have personal experience with this challenge, which gives me insights into what features would be most useful. This problem affects a large community of fitness enthusiasts, so there's some sort of demand. 

### 2. Inconsistent budgeting and expense tracking
This problem is extremely widespread and affects virtually everyone who manages their own finances. Poor financial tracking can lead to serious long-term consequences. I have attempting working with the tediousness of manual expense tracking. This problem also has clear potential, as personal finance apps are a proven to be useful.

### 3. Making informed purchasing decisions
This problem is relevant given to any PC building and technology enthusiasts. The problem affects a broad audience of tech consumers, not just PC builders. Since these are typically pricey purchases, deciding between two similar components is more crucial. Some amount of research is required before making these purchases, so making this automated can save lots of time for the consumer.

## Exclusions

Improving sleep quality: While important, this problem is more about lifestyle changes and habit formation. Solutions would require non-technical elements like sleep education, environmental monitoring, or even medical consultation. The software component would only be limited to sleep tracking and reminders.

Tracking nutrition and meal planning: There have been many apps already tracking nutrituion for each meal. However, nutrition tracking requires users to manually input detailed food information, which creates a high barrier to consistent usage and makes the app less likely to be adopted long-term.

Overspending on unnecessary items: This is more of a behavioral/psychological problem. While software may help with tracking and alerts, the issue requires self-discipline and financial education more.

Lack of financial planning for future goals: This problem requires lots of financial knowledge and only simple calculations can be created since the economy can't be predicted. Seeking professionals may be a better option to specially cater to your personal financial situation.

Staying current to new technologies: This problem is requires the user to constantly stay up to date with various news. I think looking through and staying up to date with tech news can solve this problem rather than an application.

Learning new technologies and skills: While important, this problem is more about content creation and educational methodology than software development. The technical challenges would be limited to content delivery and progress tracking, which are less engaging from a development perspective.

## Stakeholders

### 1. Forgetting previous workouts or weights
- **Fitness Enthusiasts** - Individuals who regularly exercise and track their progress
- **Personal Trainers** - Professionals who help clients achieve fitness goals
- **Everyday People** - People who do not regularly exercise

Fitness enthusiasts are the primary users who would directly benefit from better workout tracking, leading to more consistent progress and motivation. Personal trainers would be significantly affected as they could better monitor client progress and provide more accurate guidance based on historical data. This could improve their service quality and client retention. Everyday people who don't regularly exercise would be positively impacted as better tracking tools could lower the barrier to starting a fitness routine by providing clear guidance on what to do and how to progress, potentially encouraging them to become more active and develop healthier habits.

### 2. Inconsistent budgeting and expense tracking
- **Individual Consumers** - People managing their personal finances
- **Financial Advisors** - Professionals who provide financial planning services
- **Banks and Financial Institutions** - Organizations that provide banking and credit services

Individual consumers are the direct users who would benefit from improved financial awareness and better spending habits, potentially leading to increased savings and financial security. Financial advisors would be positively impacted as clients with better financial tracking would be easier to work with and could achieve better financial outcomes, improving advisor-client relationships. Banks and financial institutions would benefit from customers with better financial habits, as this could lead to reduced interest rates, better credit scores, and more stable banking relationships.

### 3. Making informed purchasing decisions
- **Tech Consumers** - Individuals purchasing technology products
- **Retailers and E-commerce Platforms** - Companies selling technology products
- **Technology Manufacturers** - Companies producing the hardware and software being compared

Tech consumers are the primary users who would benefit from better purchasing decisions, potentially saving money and avoiding buyer's remorse. Retailers and e-commerce platforms would be significantly affected as better-informed consumers might make more confident purchases, potentially increasing conversion rates and customer satisfaction. However, they might also face more price competition. Technology manufacturers would be impacted as better comparison tools could highlight product strengths and weaknesses more clearly, potentially influencing their product development and marketing strategies to better meet consumer needs.
